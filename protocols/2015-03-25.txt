* GAPT Meeting Protocol *
 ***********************

Date: 25.3.
People: Christoph, Daniel, Gabriel, Giselle, Sebastian, Stefan
Protocol by: Stefan

* regression: bottom/top in CNF -> transfer to PCNF
  -> Daniel documents this as issue
  in general: author of commit that causes regression should either fix the
  problem or document it sufficiently well that somebody else can fix it.

* location of examples
  -> scripts vs. packages -- still to be discussed

* replacement bug
  -> replacements should be subsumed by HOLPositions-etc. - code

* layer-structure
  -> Daniel's proposal looks good, detail still to be discussed
     will be implemented only after Sebastian's restructure branch is done
