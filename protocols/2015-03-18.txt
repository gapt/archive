 ***********************
* GAPT Meeting Protocol *
 ***********************

Date: 18.3.
People: Christoph, Daniel, Gabriel, Sebastian, Stefan
Protocol by: Stefan

* Gabriel starts implementing schematic grammars and computation of schematic
  grammar from instances languages, will partially use Christoph's code, will
  in the long term subsume his code

* issue 292:
  layer-structure should be reformed ASAP but only after restructure is merged

  plan:
  only one copy of lambda calculus, traits like FOLFormula, FOLTerm, etc.  only
  for designated subsets of the typed lambda terms, no more factories, one
  central point where traits are 'slapped on' - this must be in App- and
  Abs-constructors because of goal: if two typed lambda terms are equal they
  must have the same traits. This may require 'intermediate' traits like
  partialFOLFormula, mainly intended for internal use of trait-slapper

* prover-interface(s)
  convention: free variable are considered as universally quantified

  prover9-interface replaces variable x by constant x obtains const-version
  from prover9 and undoes replacement re-introducing variables before passing
  proof to user. Should be possible to refactor in such a way that it can
  be re-used by veriT (but undoing replacement needs to be done on expansion
  proofs instead of resolution proofs).

* gapt will be used in Stefan's course on automated deduction:
  exercises, etc. maybe into repository
