 ***********************
* GAPT Meeting Protocol *
 ***********************

Date: 22.4.
People: Daniel, Gabriel, Sebastian, Stefan
Protocol by: Stefan

* induction branch
  will contain implementation of inductive theorem prover (by Gabriel and Sebastian),
  including refactoring of grammar-code (creating a purely formal language-theoretic level)

* layer reform
  plan has settled, should be possible to implement rather quickly (~1 month),
  we will still decide when/how to merge in order not to disturb cut-intro experiments

* cut-intro experiments
  should be moved into a stable branch once code in master is feature-complete.
