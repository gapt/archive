* GAPT Meeting Protocol *
 ***********************

Date: Oct. 16, 2025
People: Fabian Achammer, Stefan Hetzl, Bernhard Öllerer, Martin Riener
Protocol by: Stefan

* scala 2 to scala 3 transition is completed

* TPTP TFF Parser
  Parsing is completed for monomorphic many-sorted types, proof reconstruction
  does not yet work (problem: FOLClause,... is one-sorted FOL)

* RingInv Project
  Short presentation of Bernhard Öllerer's bachelor project (see
  examples/ringinv)

* Feedback on / Wishlist for gaptic language:
  - sorry tactic (to avoid complaints of the system)
  - debug tactic (that only displays current goal)
  - automation for quantifier-free FOL with equality, e.g., for goals such as
    s=t -> t=s.
  - .forget should work for equality tactics eql and eqr (it should drop the
    equation)

* Proof checking competition
  We plan to submit gapt to the TPTP proof checking competition. Central open
  problem: verification of clause form transformation (including
  Skolemisation). Approach: Do it ourselves, match our result against prover.
  Martin, Stefan and Fabian will work on that.
