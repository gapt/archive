* GAPT Meeting Protocol *
 ***********************

Date: 16.2.
People: Christoph, Daniel, Gabriel, Giselle, Martin, Sebastian, Stefan
Protocol by: Stefan

Protocol: 

* Daniels changes to prover9 import - performance vs fails
The question is why there are additional regressions with timeouts with the new fixDerivation code. Daniel mentioned that the order of the fixes in fixDerivation is in a way, that the new code is only called when the old one fails.
-> Gabriel will create a list of new timeouts.

* new regression test: prover9 import validation fails often because veriT is not installed on compile server
veriT is installed now -> only 250 failures

* Daniel: Multiset FClauses?
-> FClause.toHash should be changed to work reasonably (Gabriel)
-> in the long term: reform of FClause, Clause, FSequent, Sequent into common interface is due

* Sebastians restructure branch
-> there should not be any more objects/classes with the same name in different packages
